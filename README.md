Python: Real-time face mask Detection with Colab (GPU), Yolov3 and OpenCV

Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, YOLOv3 using Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as videos.

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19.
